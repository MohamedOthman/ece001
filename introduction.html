        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>A programming language is a formal language which includes a set of instructions that produce different output types. The programming languages are used to implement algorithms in computer programming. Most programming languages consist of the computer instructions. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions instead of programming languages generally. The early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer.Computer programming language is known as program source coding. A computer machine without a program is like coffee without sugar or a morning without the sun. Computer programs can range from two to millions of lines of instructions. Just as there are several languages in the human world, there are also several computer programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, C, Perl, PHP and Ruby.English is the most popular and well-known Human Language. The English language has its own set of grammar rules, which has to be followed to write in the English language correctly.Just like human languages, programming languages also follow grammar called syntax. There are certain basic program code elements which are common for all the programming languages.
