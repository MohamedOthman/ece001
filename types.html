        <h1>Types</h1>
        <p>Procedural programming language: is used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result. This type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements.Functional programming language: typically uses stored data. It's expected that a function not modify or perform any o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. functional languages are usually easier and build it easier to figure on abstract issues. They'll even be "further from the machine" therein their programming model makes it difficult to know precisely.Object-oriented programming language: views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external accessing parts of that data. One of the main principle of object oriented programming language is encapsulation that everything an object will need must be inside of the object.Scripting Programming Language: These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements. They are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support for development of large systems.Logic Programming Language: Most of the languages include ideas and features from various domains. It's easy to program in an object-oriented style in C language. Most of the programming languages do not best in all styles of programming. C is the most popular language for programming in the C programming language.  </p>
